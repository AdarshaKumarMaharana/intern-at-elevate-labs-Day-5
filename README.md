# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation - Java Console Application

This is a simple **console-based Bank Account Simulation** built in Java as part of an internship task.  
The application allows users to **create an account**, **deposit money**, **withdraw money**, **view balance**, and **check transaction history** through a clean, menu-driven interface.
